# Elections-data-science
A personal project using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to apply data science methods to understand UK elections and voters. Commonly used packages throughout the project include Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. The project has 2 main components parts:
- Data analysis and visualisation: Using popular packages and custom hand built solutions to preform data visualisation and statistical analysis of elections and voters. Primary example is https://github.com/graemeaheron/Elections-data-science/blob/master/2015%20general%20election%20data%20analysis.ipynb. Visualisations include Sankey diagrams to show flows in voting behaviour and geographical representations of the UK to display data and trends on a constituency by constituency basis.
- Machine learning: Applying machine learning models to try and predict voting intentions. I have tried a couple of different appraoches. The main example is https://github.com/graemeaheron/Elections-data-science/blob/master/Modelling%20voter%20choice.ipynb. This uses survey data, random forests, neural networks and hyperparameter optimisation to model the voting choices of individuals. I have also attempted to create a Bayesian multi-level regression with poststratification model though with less success.

This project also required a significant amount of data collection and preprocessing.

This is an in progress project.
